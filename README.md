# Weather Conditions Analysis During World War Two

## Project Overview

This project involves the analysis of weather conditions recorded daily at various weather stations around the world during World War Two. The dataset contains information on precipitation, snowfall, temperatures, wind speed, and the presence of thunderstorms or other poor weather conditions. The primary objective is to understand temperature trends and build predictive models for temperature forecasting.

## Project Structure

- `Summary of Weather.csv`: Directory containing the dataset.
- `Climate Insights Analysis Project.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook used for data analysis and modeling.
- `Climate Insights Analysis Project.pdf`: Pdf file exported from Jupyter notebook used for data analysis and modeling.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Usage

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: The Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory provide detailed EDA, including visualizations and summary statistics.
- **Predictive Modeling**: The notebooks and scripts demonstrate the process of building and evaluating predictive models for temperature forecasting.

## Results

- The Linear Regression model demonstrated superior performance with an MAE score of \(4.23 \times 10^{-9}\) and an RÂ² score of 1, indicating a perfect fit.
- Decision Tree and Random Forest models also performed well but were slightly less accurate compared to Linear Regression.

## Conclusion

The analysis provides valuable insights into temperature trends during World War Two, and the predictive models offer accurate temperature forecasting capabilities. Linear Regression emerged as the best-performing model for this dataset.
